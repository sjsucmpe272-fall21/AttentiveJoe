## Wildfire prediction 
### Problem Statement
In 2020 the US experienced about 52,113 wildfire situations. The wildfires have become as common as the weather conditions like lightning, thunderstorm, tornados, rains. Moreover thereâ€™s a severe need for a wildfire prediction Technology, Which can help the citizens to be alert well before any calamity takes place.
### Abstract
Based on multiple factors like, temperature, dry weather, last rain, lightning due to which wildfire occurred previously  can be fed into a model which will notify/predict about possible wildfire based on the current temperature and weather conditions.
### Approach

Temperature, precipitation and drought will be the three main factors for prediction.
Based on the dataset of previous fires, which have information of date, time and location. We can get weather conditions of the same day at specific locations and predict based on it. These data can be retrieved from below datasets.

### Persona
1. Local government
Government can prepare in advance and plan to handle worse weather conditions and perform measures like evacuation of people from potential areas which can be affected.
2. General public
People can get updates on the prediction of fire in their area and shift to other places based on the severity of the prediction.
