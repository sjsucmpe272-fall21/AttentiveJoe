## Ccaas - contact center as a service
### Problem Statement
To enhance agent work efficiency, by answering most common questions automatically and then actually getting involved in solving the most needed question can be achieved by strategically routing the call/chat to a human agent by implementing AI ML. This can involve sentiment analysis so that the most skilled agent can handle a furious customer. 

### Abstract
AI ML in CCaas can help with reducing call/chat volumes by smartly answering the basic FAQ's using chatbot or through IVR (interactive voice response)or by offering  smart routing of call/chat to experienced agents based on the caller. The human agent is already prepared with basic information of the customer while getting on the actual call. It can help with customer retention and significant improvement in revenue and profit.

### Approach
Make use of api’s and use of chatbot to answer some faq’s and then create a calendar event if the interaction between customer and agent goes through successfully.
Note: Need more clarification on the approach.
