## Wildfire prediction 
### Problem Statement
In 2020 the US experienced about 52,113 wildfire situations. The wildfires have become as common as the weather conditions like lightning, thunderstorm, tornados, rains. Moreover there’s a severe need for a wildfire prediction Technology, Which can help the citizens to be alert well before any calamity takes place. 

### Abstract
Based on multiple factors like, temperature, dry weather, last rain, lightning due to which wildfire occurred previously  can be fed into a model which will notify/predict about possible wildfire based on the current temperature and weather conditions.

### Approach
Temperature, precipitation and drought will be the three main factors for prediction.
Based on the dataset of previous fires, which have information of date, time and location. We can get weather conditions of the same day at specific locations and predict based on it. These data can be retrieved from below datasets.

### Persona
1. Local government
Government can prepare in advance and plan to handle worse weather conditions and perform measures like evacuation of people from potential areas which can be affected.
2. General public
People can get updates on the prediction of fire in their area and shift to other places based on the severity of the prediction.

## Student Fatigue Detection in Virtual Classroom
### Problem Statement
Nowadays, Online video education is steadily becoming more important. The reasons are not only geographical differences between the teacher and the student, but also new teaching concepts such as “flipped classroom" and various other factors as well. In the U.S.A. already 60% of the 50 Million students use online education. Recently the pandemic has made all the modes of teachings virtual which even more emphasizes the need to build this system.

### Abstract
Learning through online video is extremely popular. But there's no thanks to determine whether a student is really taking note of a lecture. An algorithm for real-time eye state classification employing a simple webcam is presented.Here one application is developed during which the eyes of the person seated ahead of the camera are detected employing a classifier.Mainly there are Four different eye positions: looking straight, looking left, looking upward, and searching right are classified with the assistance of K-means clustering of the features of detecting eyes. Supported by these a prediction is formed to state whether the scholar is drowsy or not.

### Approach
We used techniques like face and eye detection, eye tracking, and eye state classification area. Viola and Jones have used a boosted cascade of features to detect particular objects. Template matching and support vector machine-based approach is employed to detect eye from the face image.The most important application of eye-tracking, i.e. drowsiness detection. The float boost learning for classification is used. And the concept of Clustering and regression is used for eye state classification.

## Ccaas - contact center as a service
### Problem Statement
To enhance agent work efficiency, by answering most common questions automatically and then actually getting involved in solving the most needed question can be achieved by strategically routing the call/chat to a human agent by implementing AI ML. This can involve sentiment analysis so that the most skilled agent can handle a furious customer. 

### Abstract
AI ML in CCaas can help with reducing call/chat volumes by smartly answering the basic FAQ's using chatbot or through IVR (interactive voice response)or by offering  smart routing of call/chat to experienced agents based on the caller. The human agent is already prepared with basic information of the customer while getting on the actual call. It can help with customer retention and significant improvement in revenue and profit.

### Approach
Make use of api’s and use of chatbot to answer some faq’s and then create a calendar event if the interaction between customer and agent goes through successfully.
Note: Need more clarification on the approach.

## Text summarization of Research papers
### Problem Statement
The world of the Internet has grown at a tremendous rate and hence there is a lot of data over the web pages. The Process of reading the documents, Research/Technical papers, and analyzing them is a daunting task. Moreover, new researchers and even experienced people feel it difficult sometimes to examine the complete paper. The Text Summarization would go over the research paper and would provide a simplified informative summary for the respective paper.

### Abstract
Academicians and Researchers examine multiple research papers for their work, to get a better understanding of research done in that particular subject. Text Summarization portal can provide informative summaries of technical/research papers and can make their process easier and less time-consuming. We will provide a system that will summarize the research/technical documents and provide informative and accurate summaries to the respective document.   

### Approach
Spacy is an advanced NLP library, which provides features like POS tagging, Sentence boundary detection & Text Classification. Provided these features we can Extract Important sentences and phrases from research papers and form a meaningful summary from those important sets of keywords and sentences.

### Persona
