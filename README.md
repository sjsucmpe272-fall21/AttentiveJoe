### Problem Statement
Nowadays, Online video education is steadily becoming more important. The reasons are not only geographical differences between the teacher and the student, but also new teaching concepts such as â€œflipped classroom" and various other factors as well. In the U.S.A. nearly 60% of the students use online education. Recently the pandemic has made all the modes of teachings virtual which even more emphasizes the need to build this system.

### Abstract
Learning through online video is extremely popular. But there's no way to determine whether a student is actively participating in a lecture. An algorithm for real-time eye state classification employing a simple webcam is presented.Here one application is developed during which the eyes of the person seated ahead of the camera are detected employing a classifier.Mainly there are Four different eye positions: looking straight, looking left, looking upward, and searching right are classified with the assistance of K-means clustering of the features of detecting eyes. Supported by these a prediction is formed to state whether the attendant is distracted or not.

### Approach
We used techniques like face and eye detection, eye tracking, and eye state classification area. Viola and Jones have used a boosted cascade of features to detect particular objects. Template matching and support vector machine-based approach is employed to detect eye from the face image.The most important application of eye-tracking, i.e. drowsiness detection. The float boost learning for classification is used. And the concept of Clustering and regression is used for eye state classification.
