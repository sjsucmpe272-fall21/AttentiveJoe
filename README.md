## Wildfire prediction 
### Problem Statement
In 2020 the US experienced about 52,113 wildfire situations. The wildfires have become as common as the weather conditions like lightning, thunderstorm, tornados, rains. Moreover there’s a severe need for a wildfire prediction Technology, Which can help the citizens to be alert well before any calamity takes place.

### Abstract
Based on multiple factors like, temperature, dry weather, last rain, lightning due to which wildfire occurred previously  can be fed into a model which will notify/predict about possible wildfire based on the current temperature and weather conditions.

### Approach
Temperature, precipitation and drought will be the three main factors for prediction.
Based on the dataset of previous fires, which have information of date, time and location. We can get weather conditions of the same day at specific locations and predict based on it. These data can be retrieved from below datasets.

### Persona
1. Local government
Government can prepare in advance and plan to handle worse weather conditions and perform measures like evacuation of people from potential areas which can be affected.
2. General public
People can get updates on the prediction of fire in their area and shift to other places based on the severity of the prediction.

## Student Fatigue Detection in Virtual Classroom
### Problem Statement
Nowadays, Online video education is steadily becoming more important. Reasons are not only geographical differences between the teacher and the student but also new teaching concepts such as “flipped classroom" and various other factors as well. In the U.S.A. already 60% of the 50 Million students use online education. Recently the pandemic has made all the modes of teachings virtual which even more emphasizes the need to build this system.

### Abstract
Learning through online video is extremely popular. But there is no way to determine whether a student is actually watching a video or not. In this paper, an algorithm for real-time eye state classification using a simple webcam is presented. Here one application is developed in which the eyes of the person seated in front of the camera are detected using a classifier. Mainly there are Four different eye positions: looking straight, looking left, looking upward, and looking right are classified with the help of K-means clustering of the features of detected eyes. Based on these a prediction is made to state whether the student is drowsy or not.

### Approach
We used techniques like face and eye detection, eye tracking, and eye state classification area. Viola and Jones have used a boosted cascade of features to detect particular objects. Template matching and support vector machine-based approach is employed to detect eye from the face image. The most important application of eye-tracking i.e. drowsiness detection. The float boost learning for classification is used. And the concept of Clustering and regression is used for eye state classification.

## Text summarization of Research papers
### Problem Statement
The Internet has grown at a tremendous rate and hence there is a lot of data and documents across the web pages. The Process of reading the documents, Research/Technical papers and analysing it is a daunting task. Moreover new researchers and also experienced people feel it difficult sometimes to analyse the complete paper. The Text Summarization would analyse the different formats of research papers and would provide simplified informative summaries for the documents.

### Abstract
Currently there are a lot of people who are analysing research papers for their research, better understanding and project implementations. Providing a platform that can provide informative summaries of technical papers can make their process easier and less time consuming. In this paper we will be analysing various methods to summarize the research papers and provide solutions with the most accurate and faster solution.  

### Approach
Spacy is an advanced NLP library, which provides features like POS tagging, Sentence boundary detection & Text Classification. Provided these features we can Extract Important sentences and phrases from research papers and form a meaningful summary from those important sets of keywords and sentences.
